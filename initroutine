3 Modes: Single player, 2-player co-op, n-player arena
(ignore for now) Will need to modify camera to accomodate multiple players: 2 player = split screen, arena = 1 screen without scrolling.
(ignore for now) Need to be able to load different players in different locations for arena mode
Need to be able to determine mode based on level, allow an appropriate number of players to join
Need to be able to modify inputMaps, assign input devices to players in the menus
Doors: Will wait for all players to interact with door before going to next room.
Saves: All players will share save data.
