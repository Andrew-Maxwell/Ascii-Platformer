Features:
- Water:
    - interacting with forcefield: standing wave, produces moving wave when released + drops flying into air
    - Bullets underwater
    - PhysicalEntity density parameter defines buoyancy
- Generic physicalEntity width parameter
- Improved code interface
    - Intercepted codes
    - Colored based on code value
    - Broadcast animation
    - Indicators showing how many codes you've collected/total in the level
- Puzzle elements:
    - Switches
    - Triggers
    - Color changing/other effect layers
    - AND/OR/Timer relays
    - Doors
    - Moving platforms
    - Guns/turrets/enemies
- Explosions: Powerful invisible forcefields that self-delete after one tick
- Overhaul movement: tweak everything. Decide how you want it to be *before* you start making levels.
- Wind/current object (or maybe put it in the collider?)
- leaf physicalParticles that fly eratically
- Digital corruption visual effect; layer turns into random characters suddenly, gradually resolves back into
    original.

Ideas:
    - Cyberpunk theme: Parallel digital and physical realms, distinct visual style, distinct puzzle types
    - Level where you find breath upgrades above water and ops below water - back and forth between those two
    - Level that is completely dark, must use bouncing particle explosion effect to navigate
    - WRT puzzles: Should give player feedback on plausible but wrong attempts, keep them entertained
    - You have a computer companion which is what allows you to broadcast codes. It has a test level which acts as
        the tutorial, also has randomly-generated puzzles with small bonuses.
    - Command line graphical effect when logging into a terminal.


inspiration/vague visual ideas:
    - Giant drum machine like washing machine
    - Submechanophobia
    - Trippy AI face that speaks to you/watches you in the virtual world
        - AI doesn't want you poking around, if you go to far into his world he threatens you then starts killing you
            IRL and you have to get out of the level before he kills you entirely. Makes more sense if you don't usually
            have a health bar in the virtual world. Making virtual world one-hit-kill makes sense for small, puzzle-oriented levels.
    

Housekeeping items:
- Replace drawBar() with a rectangle-drawing function.
- Use ImageDrawTextEx to generate layer image files when entering a room; massive performance improvements.
- Docs, including "lessons learned"
- Replace x, y with Vector2 everywhere
- Create configure() functions rather than having 10-argument constructors/standardize constructor argument order
- Cap line lengths
- change everything from camelCase to PascalCase
- rename sizeFactor to Scale
- make layer use char[][] for mild performance benefits

Bugs:
- player disappears when standing on tile right below top of level
- touch pickups sometimes collected (?) randomly
- Markers appearing in wrong place in level editor
- "Not a valid choice!" error appears when using op screen
- Bullets disappear on contact with particles such as raindrops
