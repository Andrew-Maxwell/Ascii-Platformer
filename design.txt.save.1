GOAL:

Create a platformer with:
- Inertia-based movement puzzles like Portal, with bit puzzles playing a side role.
- Beautiful, immersive environments that demand exploration, like Rain World
- Responsive movement system, easy to learn, hard to master, like Celeste
- Exciting story, like Cave Story

FEATURES:

Sample game session:
Player runs the game. Game starts in menu system which allows the player to (at the minimum)
adjust controls, select gamepad or keyboard input, adjust audio volume, and change resolution/
scaling properties. The player loads a previous save and begins playing.

- Entity-handling system allowing entities (including player) to be created, deleted, interact
    - Allows for multiple "player" entities (e.g. player takes control of drone, but old body doesn't disappear.)
- Gamepad support
- Audio: Sound effects and music
- Map? Could do something interesting similar to asciigen, or just make it pixel-by-pixel
- Menu system
    - Can adjust controls
- Story
    - Persistent variables, stored in save file, which affect entity loading
        - Affected by NPCs and bosses
