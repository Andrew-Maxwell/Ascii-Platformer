File format:

The level editor does not have the capability to manage files. In order to modify level parameters,
add additional layers, or add interactive entities, editing the text file directly is necessary.

newlevel.cpp can be used to generate a simple empty level, but it must be modified to add color.

Each room consists of an entity file, a collider file, and multiple layer files.
The entity file is typically named with the level name, e.g. level.txt It contains a
    list of all of the information required for every entity, including the layers.
The collider file is typically named e.g. level_collider.txt. It provides information
    on which blocks are solid, which blocks are zero- gravity (WIP), etc.
The layer files are typically named e.g. level_layer0.txt, level_layer1.txt, ... (but
    can have a more informative name if desired) just store a bunch of utf-8 characters
    to be displayed as a layer.

Entity file format:
The first line is the collider file name, followed by R, G, B, A values for the background.
Each following line specifies an entity. Entities lower on the list will be displayed in front
    of entities higher on the list. Each entity has the same first eight info fields:
     [Character indicator] [x position] [y position] [R] [G] [B] [A] [size multiplier]

Some entities have fields with additional information:
    Layer: L [x position] [y position] [R] [G] [B] [A] [size multiplier] [layer file name]
    Ending gate: E [x position] [y position] [R] [G] [B] [A] [size multiplier] [width*] [height*] *currently ignored
    Door: D [x position] [y position] [R] [G] [B] [A] [size multiplier] [Destination room's entity file] [destination x] [destination y]
    Save point: S [x position] [y position] [R] [G] [B] [A] [size multiplier]
    Player: @ [x position] [y position] [R] [G] [B] [A] [size multiplier]
    Force field: F [x position] [y position] [R] [G] [B] [A] [size multipler] [power, in tiles^2/tick] [range, in tiles]
    Rain spawner: R [x position] [y position] [R] [G] [B] [A] [drops per tick]

Editor features:

The editor is modeled somewhat after an image editor, but with more keyboard shortcuts and less GUI.

Basic navigation:
    Press c to select the next layer, x to select the previous layer. The collider layer is always
        at the very front, and is filled with dots by default.
    Press h to show/hide the current layer.
    Arrow keys or right click and drag to navigate.

Brushes and fills:
    Editing revolves around "brushes", which define a shape, and "fills", which define a pattern
    or set of characters to fill that shape.

    In the upper right hand of the screen is a palette of currently selected fills. Swap fills using
    the f1-f12 or 9-0 keys.  The collider layer has a separate palette. Middle click to fill the current
    palette slot with a fill containing only the character you middle-clicked on in the selected layer.

    Left click on the level to apply a brush with that fill. Some brushes require multiple clicks to apply.
    Press CTRL+Z to clear an incomplete brush selection.

    In order to swap fills, hold down "tab" to see a selection of all available fills. Click on a fill
    to swap the currently selected palette swap to that fill. Fills take three forms: static
    fills that only have a single character, random fills that randomly select from a predefined
    set of characters, and patterned fills such as grids or textures. Patterned fills flash the
    number of the grid size or pattern.

    While holding tab, you can also increase or decrease the density of the brush by pressing x or c.
    The current density appears in the bottom left. Hold shift to adjust more quickly. Z will reset
    density to 1; shift-z will set it to 0.

    While holding tab, you can swap brushes by pressing an appropriate keyboard shortcut. The current
    brush appears in the bottom left. The following brushes are available:

    (P)encil: Changes a single character at a time.
    (B)ox: Change an area shaped like a rectangle, aligned to the grid. Click twice to define opposite
        corners of the box.
    (D)iamond: Like the Box, only the box's sides are at a 45 degree angle to the grid.
    (E)ntity placeholder: Click to add a placeholder entity to the entity file. These entities must be
        changed to match a real entity before the level can be played.
    (Q)uadrilateral: Allows for drawing (messy) parallelograms with arbitrary-angles in the corners.
    (G)radient: Draws a parallelogram filled with a gradient using Unicode shade characters
    (F) Coarse gradient: Draws a parallelogram filled with a gradient using rectangular characters.
    (R)agged: Draws a line with spikes coming off at an angle. Good for e.g. icicles.
    (S)elect: Used to cut and paste.
    (T)ransfer (or replace): Click once to replace every character matching the clicked one with the
        selected fill.
    
Color tweaks:
    Press R, G, B, or A while not in the tab screen to decrease the level of that color in the current
    layer's color. Press SHIFT+R, G, B, or A to increase it. If you modify the colors, then a modified
    layer entity entry will be entered to the end of entity file with the new color values. It must be
    copy-pasted over the old layer entity in order to finish the change.

Undo, Redo, and Save:
    Press CTRL+Z to undo the last change to the current layer.
    Press CTRL+Y to redo the last change to the current layer.
    Press CTRL+S to save ALL layers. If you do not save changes, you will be asked if you want to
        when you quit.

Selection, copying and pasting:
    Press Tab+S to enter Selection mode. This selects a rectangular area between two clicks, similar
    to the box brush. If you click more than twice, then the 
    Press CTRL+A to automatically switch to the Selection brush and select the entire layer.
    Press CTRL+C to copy, CTRL+X to cut from a selected box.
    CTRL+V will paste with the upper-right hand corner of the clipboard box at the selected point.
    If no point is selected, then it will paste starting in the upper right hand corner of the layer. 
    Press "Enter" to create a new texture fill from the clipboard (WIP)
